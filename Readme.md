# LN Automation Framework

This is a robust, scalable, and reusable test automation framework built using Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, and Java. The framework supports cross-browser testing, intelligent waits, and integrates with Allure for detailed test reports. It is designed following best practices such as DRY and SOLID principles.

## Overview

The LexisNexis Automation Framework is designed to test web applications efficiently. It uses:
- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation.
- **Cucumber** for BDD-style test scenarios.
- **JUnit** to run tests.
- **Allure** for generating interactive test reports.
- **Maven** for dependency management and build automation.

The framework is built to be OS-independent, easily configurable via external properties, and scalable for future enhancements.

## Running Tests

To build the project and run tests, execute the following command from the project root:

- mvn clean install
- mvn test

This command will:
1. Clean the `target` directory.
2. Download and install dependencies
3. Compile the code.
4. Run the Cucumber tests via the JUnit runner defined in `CucumberTestRunner.java`.

## Generating Allure Reports

To generate and view an Allure report after the tests have run, execute:

mvn allure:serve -Dallure.results.directory=allure-results

This command will build the Allure report and launch a local server so you can view the report in your browser.

## CI/CD Integration

This framework is designed to be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines. For example:

- **Jenkins**:  
  - Configure your Jenkins job to run `mvn clean test` and then `mvn allure:report` to generate reports.
- **GitHub Actions**:  
  - Create a workflow that runs Maven commands for testing and report generation.
- **Other CI/CD Tools**:  
  - The same Maven commands (`mvn clean test` and `mvn allure:serve` or `mvn allure:report`) can be used.
